Build Plan: Frontend User Interface
(React.js)
This document outlines a phased development plan for the React-based Frontend User Interface.
The approach is designed to deliver a functional and intuitive user experience incrementally,
aligning with the backend services' development.
Phase 1: Foundation & Core Study Management
Goal: Establish the application's structure, set up user authentication, and build the core
interfaces for managing research studies.
 Key Objectives & Milestones Technologies & Libraries
Project Setup & Architecture: - Initialize React project with
TypeScript (e.g., using Vite). - Integrate a UI component
library (e.g., Material-UI, Shadcn/UI). - Set up routing, global
state management (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit), and API
client (e.g., Axios). - Create a main application layout
(sidebar, header, content area).
- Framework: React.js,
TypeScript - UI Library:
Material-UI or Ant Design -
State Management: Zustand
or Redux Toolkit
Authentication & Dashboards: - Build login/logout
functionality, connecting to the Central Backend's auth
endpoints. - Implement protected routes for authenticated
users. - Create a shell for the main Dashboard, including basic
widgets and alert components.
- Routing: React Router
Study Management Interface: - Develop UI for listing,
creating, and viewing research studies. - Create a form for
defining study objectives and criteria. - Connect all
components to the corresponding APIs on the Central
Backend.
- Forms: React Hook Form
Deliverable: A secure, single-page application where authorized users can log in, view a
dashboard, and manage the lifecycle of research studies.
Phase 2: Data Interaction & Visualization (Weeks 4-6)
Goal: Implement the dynamic form system for data entry and build interfaces for visualizing
matched patients and key metrics.

Key Objectives & Milestones Technologies &
Libraries
Dynamic Form Rendering: - Develop a component that
dynamically renders a form based on a JSON Schema fetched from
the backend. - Implement the standardized data entry view, clearly
differentiating pre-populated and manually entered data.
- JSON Schema: rjsf
(React JSON Schema
Form) or custom renderer.
Case Matching Visualization: - Create the UI to display lists of
potentially eligible patients returned by the AI service. - Design
components for researchers to review patient details, validate the
match, and confirm eligibility.
- UI Component Library
Dashboard Enhancement & Basic Stats: - Populate dashboard
widgets with real data (e.g., enrollment progress). - Integrate a
charting library to display simple trend graphs. - Build the
interface for basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.).
- Charts: Chart.js or D3.js
(via a React wrapper like
Recharts)
Deliverable: An interactive interface allowing users to enter data via dynamic forms, review AIsuggested patient matches, and monitor study progress on a visual dashboard.
Phase 3: Generative AI Integration & Data Export (Weeks 7-8)
Goal: Weave the LLM's capabilities directly into the user workflow to provide intelligent
assistance and enable easy data export.
Key Objectives & Milestones Technologies &
Libraries
Direct GenAI Interaction: - Criteria Augmentation: Enhance the study
criteria form to call the GenAI service, showing suggestions in real-time. -
Note Summarization: Add a "Summarize" button/icon next to long text
fields that opens a pop-up with a concise summary from the LLM.
- API Client
(Axios, Fetch)
One-Click Data Export: - Implement UI elements (e.g., buttons) to trigger
the data export process on the Central Backend. - Handle the file download
securely and provide user feedback during the export process.
- UI Component
Library
Deliverable: A "smart" UI where users can leverage generative AI for assistance and easily
export curated datasets with a single click.
Phase 4: Advanced Features, Refinement & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)
Goal: Integrate the final Q&A feature, conduct thorough testing, and prepare the application for
production deployment.
Key Objectives & Milestones Technologies &
Libraries
Contextual Q&A (RAG) Interface: - Build a chat-style
component for the contextual Q&A feature. - The interface will
- UI Component
Library
send user questions to the GenAI service and display the sourcebacked answers.
Final Testing, UX Refinement & Deployment Prep: - Conduct
end-to-end testing across the entire platform. - Focus on
responsiveness, accessibility (a11y), loading states, and consistent
error handling. - Finalize build configurations and create a
Dockerfile for easy deployment.
- Testing: Jest,
React Testing
Library
Deliverable: A polished, fully-featured, and containerized frontend application ready for
production deployment and user acceptance testing.
